# Reverse Timezone Lookup

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/stayradiated/reverse-timezone-lookup)

A simple, browser-based tool that finds timezones matching a specific target time. Instead of converting a time to different timezones, this app does the reverse: it shows you which timezones currently match your desired time.

## Features

- Find all timezones where the current time matches your target time
- Specify a threshold (in minutes) for flexibility
- Results are sorted by population to highlight the most relevant timezones
- View current time differences in minutes for each result
- Approximate population data for context
- Pure client-side application with no server dependencies
- Uses the browser's built-in Intl API for accurate timezone calculations

## Use Cases

- Finding suitable meeting times across international teams
- Identifying regions for real-time collaboration
- Planning global campaigns or events
- Optimizing customer support hours
- Finding optimal times for livestreams or broadcasts

## How to Use

1. Enter your target time in 24-hour format (e.g., `08:42`)
2. Set a threshold in minutes (e.g., `15` to find timezones within ¬±15 minutes of your target time)
3. Click "Find Timezones" to see matching results
4. Results are sorted by population size, showing the most populous matching timezones first

## Technical Details

- Fully client-side JavaScript with no dependencies
- Uses the Intl API's DateTimeFormat for accurate timezone calculations
- Compatible with all modern browsers
- Handles all IANA timezone identifiers
- Includes population estimates for context (as of 2025)
